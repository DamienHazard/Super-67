# Attributions

The graflok section of this camera is based the original G-adapter made by rodgsilva (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4249403) , modified by Thnikkamax(https://www.thingiverse.com/thnikkamax/about) for correct FFD and further modified by Cynical_potatetoe to optimize it and make it fit the Argent eyes style, and further modified by me for additional light seals and fixes.
